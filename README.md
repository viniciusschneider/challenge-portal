# challenge-portal
This project was developed to apply my knowledge after studying Vue.js, Vuex, Vue Router and Vuetify. The idea of the project is to allow the user to create their teams as well as search and create matches for them, thus defining the time and place where they will take place. For reasons of time this project was limited only to creating teams and scheduling matches, thus allowing the creation of new features in the future, such as adding players to the team. The project needs to run along with the [Back-end](https://github.com/viniciusschneider/challenge-api).
